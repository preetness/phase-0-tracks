Common HTTP Status Codes:

200 - The request was fulfilled

3xx - These sorts of codes are typically resolved by the browser, as they are redirection responses, and the browser will gather the resources from another location

403 - This error code means that accessing the requested resource is forbidden. One explanation for this error is that the client's certificate is no longer valid, or is missing. 

404 - The requested resource was not found. This is the most common error code that we encounter. 

503 - This refers to a web server simply not being available, for whatever reason(s).


Differences Between GET and POST Methods:

GET is for retrieving (or 'getting') data. 

POST is used for writing (or 'posting') data.
