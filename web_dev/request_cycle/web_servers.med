Key Design Philosophies of Linux:

* Linux assumes that the user is competent with their computer, and it gives the power to do whatever they want with their  machine

* Linux respects its users by allowing flexibility, simplicity, and the freedom to do as they please

* Linux is unique in its open-source nature (as opposed to other popular options such as Windows or Mac OS)

* It is designed with a very open-ended, feature-minded approach

* It allows its users to freely distribute copies of modified version, and to make changes as they see fit


What is a Virtual Private Server?

A VPS is a virtual machine that mimics what an actual, physical web serving machine can offer. This allows developers to serve up websites for others to access, in a way that is much cheaper than actually using a physical server. Some advantages to this approach are being able to make customizations, having complete control over your environment, and being able to dedicate resources as you please.


It is considered a bad idea to run programs as a root user because of potential security vulnerability concerns. It is best to run only administrative tasks as the root, and perform all other functions as a user.
